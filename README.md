# BSTIndexing (CSIII Final Project)

~How to Run~

Compile Program by using g++ to compile 'BSTIndexing.cpp' file.
Then run './a.out'.

Reason For Choosing Data Structure
  BST
    - Pretty Efficient ( O(N) for traversal, O(n) for insertion )
    - Easy to Index
  Selection Sort
    - relatively Efficient for small data sets ( O(N^2) )
    
Challenges
  - Connecting each interface together.
  - How to Implement the line number indexing 
  - Understanding Recursivity of BST
  
  
Explanation and Solution
  - used BST to create an alphabetically sorted tree to store words from a short story
