billy went to the store to buy some apples.
at the store the manager told him that they didnt have any.
so he got mad and called his mom.
his mom busted through the door, and made a lot of complaints.
the manager was tired so he decided to call a local farm.
the farm had to bring in apples by horse because they were actually omish.
and we all know omish apples taste the best.
when billy finally got his apples, he jumped for joy.
he then took a bite and realized he did not like apples.
so he did the same thing again but with oranges.
